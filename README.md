# Open Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) Working Group

## Vision

 **Generating Power Will Be as Easy as Plug-It-In**:
- **Ease of Energy Generation**: Make generating energy as easy as plugging in a device, thus making the production of energy as simple and straightforward as its consumption.
- **Sustainable Energy Future**: Build a sustainable energy future through open standardization that supports distributed energy self-sufficiency and collective contributions to a healthy power grid. This includes standardizing platforms such as Virtual Power Plants (VPP) and fostering the growth of distributed energy marketplaces.

## Mission Statement
To reimagine the renewable energy sector by developing an open standard architecture, API, and protocol, fostering innovation, accessibility, and sustainability.

## Background
The Open Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) Working Group was established following insights gained from the LF Research whitepaper ["The Open Source Opportunity for Microgrids: Five Ways to Drive Innovation and Overcome Market Barriers for Energy Resilience"](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/open-source-opportunity-for-microgrids). This initiative aims to design a comprehensive power network topology and define functional requirements that advance energy resilience and self-sufficiency, with a focus on Microgrids, Virtual Power Plants, and Distributed Energy Resources.

## Objectives
1. **Technical Standard Development**: Develop and validate a robust, scalable open standard architecture that includes power network topology and API definitions.
2. **Awareness and Outreach for Community Building**: 
    - Increase awareness and community building around ORES. 
    - Focus on the adoption of ORES by facilitating education, outreach, and collaborative opportunities that showcase the benefits and potential of open renewable energy systems.

## Specifications



`ORES` is a specification that describes the standard components of a renewalbe energy system, and its standard architectures, APIs, protocols among various components of the system, and communication interfaces with the grid and with higher level services. The current specification is [here](./ORES_Spec.md). The design objective of ORES is meant to realize the [vision](#vision) of plug and play energy production and democratized beneficial energy ecossystem participation, both as an energy producer and an energy consumer.
